## Starting with Rust ?

Recently, I was going through many guides and tutorials to 
have a good understanding of rust for some projects to be yet,
cooked. I thought "why not just write leave a few trails behind..

### Why Rust ?

Rust is cool : due to these reasons crabs are sexy -- **Rust** is used for 
three essential purposes in programming; **performance**, **safety**, and 
**memory management** ,also control freaks love these combo. From 
experience I tried It and there is no BS straight legit " If the code is 
perfect it will work" straight to the every detail. Long story short I was 
once learning C from scratch and at some point I loved the process but 
later on hated It. maybe i was bored or had little resources back in the 
day.. but this looks promising.

### How to start and where ?

Ok, so the materials here took some time but was worth it..
if i am about to start from begining.. will probably start from [**here**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/rust-introduction/1-introduction) 

This short tour will give you an idea 
also check out [rust-official-book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) 

If you are more of a tutorial guy just
go for it after that come back practise your skills [here](https://play.rust-lang.org) which is Rust playground to run your [code](https://play.rust-lang.org/help) and try out..

I have some other materials aswell
just **checkout**.

[**Rusty-exercises**](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises)

[**Rusty-cookbook**](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook)

[**Rust-by-practise**](https://practice.rs/why-exercise.html) or [**Rustlings**](https://rustlings.cool)



[Rusty-ext1](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust) other materials will be also updated, 
based on beginner friendly nature.

### Preparing environment for Rust programming


If you got this covered then no problem but if excited to try out:

### Install

Just go to [Rust-official](https://www.rust-lang.org) click that get started 
button and you are good to go, everything 
is there buddy..

### ENV

Setting vscodium with some plugins maybe 
fine for your average use.
plugins : rust-analyzer, CodeLLDB, Better TOML

you can add even more and make a big bloat.

For the best experience i will suggest [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/installation-guide.html#silent) by Jetbrains. The IDE dedicated for rust.


### Other 

join the r/rust community on reddit if you 
are a reddit guy or you can check out rust 
forums aswell.




## Programming Basics Cheat Sheet (rust)

## Variables and Constants

- **Variables**: Containers for storing different types of information.
  - Example: `let age = 25;`
- **Constants**: Hold unchanging values.
  - Example: `const PI: f64 = 3.14159;`

## Primitive Data Types

- **Integers**: Whole numbers.
  - Example: `let count = 10;`
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers.
  - Example: `let pi = 3.14;`
- **Characters**: Letters, symbols, or numbers.
  - Example: `let letter = 'A';`
- **Booleans**: True or false values.
  - Example: `let is_raining = false;`

## Memory Allocation

- **Stack**: Easily accessible storage.
- **Heap**: Long-term storage.

## Type Systems

- **Static Type Systems**: Fixed blocks.
- **Dynamic Type Systems**: Rebuildable blocks.

## Type Casting and Conversion

- **Casting**: Changing shape.
- **Conversion**: Translating between types.

## Bitwise Operations

- **AND, OR, XOR**: Mixing binary bits.
- **Shifting**: Moving binary bits.

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Boxes in a line.
- **Lists, Stacks, Queues**: Different organization methods.

## Binary and Hexadecimal

- **Binary**: 0s and 1s.
- **Hexadecimal**: Representing numbers with more colors (digits).

## Endianness

- **Big-Endian**: Left to right writing.
- **Little-Endian**: Right to left writing.

## Overflow and Underflow

- **Overflow**: Container too small for contents.
- **Underflow**: Trying to take out more than available.
