**Password Managers**

Do you really need a password manager? Well, if this is your first 
question, let me remind you that the weaker your password, the higher the 
risk of losing everything in one fell swoop! Passwords are a daily part of 
your life, whether you like it or not. Moreover, strong passwords, if 
created, tend to be forgotten. Writing down passwords and keeping them in a 
safe is a strategy I understand, but it comes at the cost of accessibility. 
Instead, consider using these free and open-source password managers; they 
encrypt your data and make it secure!

encryption algorithms currently known, including AES-256, ChaCha20, and 
Twofish.
